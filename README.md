# Rainfall-Prediction-Project

This project leverages machine learning models to predict next-day rainfall in Australia using a decade of weather data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. We evaluated various algorithms—including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks—under different data preprocessing techniques such as imputation, feature encoding, and selection. Our findings demonstrate that simpler preprocessing methods, like data removal, achieve comparable or better performance than more complex imputation approaches.
